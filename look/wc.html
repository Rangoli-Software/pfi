<p>From my "Move-In" Collection, garments that are easy to move in (and that are groovin'). The outfits range from basics like yoga pants and tank tops to more eclectic items - hot pants, tube top/skirt, toreador and skirted capri leggings and jazzy tops. I recently even created a small capsule of dresses for Tango dancers!

Made from a super-soft, super-comfy custom Modal Jersey, these designs work whether you're traveling, in a yoga class, at a cocktail party or just hanging out at home.</p>
