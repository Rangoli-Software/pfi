<h5>Va-Va Voom!</h5>
<p>These looks incorporate my P.F.I. Tangail fabrics, designed by me in our atelier and custom hand-woven for us by the artisanal Tangail weavers of Bengal. We commission fabrics using only the finest, softest yarns for a smooth, soft, silky feel.

<p>The fabrics in the jacket are an ivory ahimsa (non-violent) silk, a black and silver border-patterned fabric with traditional mountain motifs woven in silk and cotton, and a plain black cotton. All the fabrics are woven with the finest yarns, for a silky smooth feel.</p>
