<p>The model is wearing my one-of-a-kind ArtWear Jamdani skirt. The halter top is actually one of my dip-dye scarves with pom-pom fringes. The ensemble is accessorised with my beaded mala of semi-precious stones.</p>

<p>From sketch to weave, each thread of these ArtWear garments is designed by me and hand woven by Indian artisans from the ancient community of Tangail weavers. Invest in a garment that nobody else owns and cherish the fruits of this heritage tradition.</p>
