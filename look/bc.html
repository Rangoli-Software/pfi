<h4>Balearic Boho</h4>
<p>Some images from a Red Carpet show on the Balearic Island of Ibiza produced by the students and staff of <a href="https://www.fak-koeln.de/" target="_blank">FAK - Freie Akademie KÃ¶ln</a>. They went with a boho-chic look and I really enjoyed the way they styled my creations.</p>

<p>The model is wearing my one-of-a-kind ArtWear Jamdani skirt. The halter top is actually one of my dip-dye scarves with pom-pom fringes. The ensemble is accessorised with my beaded mala of semi-precious stones.</p>

<p>The models are both walking in my Jamdani Naksha dress, a style of one-of-a-kind dresses from my ArtWear line.</p>

<p>From sketch to weave, each thread of these ArtWear garments is designed by me and hand woven by Indian artisans from the ancient community of Tangail weavers. Invest in a garment that nobody else owns and cherish the fruits of this heritage tradition.</p>
