    <p>Her designs start with fabric innovation, based on the highest quality hand-woven cotton and silk sari textiles. Each style is created by playing with texture, colour, layers and light. Prema likes to continuously infuse influences from her travels around the world and interactions with her contemporaries. Her garments express a youthful, classy and feminine beauty.</p>

    <p>For Prema what is important is that Rangoli is run in a sustainable fashion and that the ancient handloom tradition lives on and is celebrated! In practice, this translates to use of non-toxic dyes, fair trade income for everyone in the supply chain, ongoing ecological education for all workers and extensive recycling.</p>
