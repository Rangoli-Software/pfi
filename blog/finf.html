		<p>This is me at Piazzale Michelangelo square, which offers a stunning view of the city. In the panoramic background of the first picture, you can clearly see the famous Duomo and the bell-tower of the Badia Florentina. The second image shows a bronze replica of Michelangelo's David that graces the terrace of the square.

		<p>In these pictures, I am wearing my own creations. The leggings are in modal jersey with decorative jeans-style stitching for faux hip-pockets and seams. I originally created these Jeggings en soie, in a sexy silk spandex, and the jersey version came later. The top is a Border-Back(less) Top, in modal jersey, with my P.F.I Tangail borders used to create the patchwork style half-back. This creation showcases another of my signature design elements - the use of cutouts and windows in unusual places.The look is completed by the Handloom Handbag, a Pom-Pom ear-cuff and Pom-Pom bangles.

		<p>I spent the afternoon at the lovely Boboli Gardens, a beautiful park created by the Medicis in the 16th century. I found this wall just outside. There was a public drinking water fountain beside it, one of the very few that we found in the city.

			Here I'm wearing my Celia Skirt in the Black and Silver P.F.I. Tangail, accessorized by a Pom-Pom ear-cuff and Pom-Pom bangles. And yes, the sun-glasses are cute, but those are by Dior, not by me.

			This is taken from the breakfast terrace of my hotel. As you can see, the location was fantastic, with a stunning view of the Duomo Cathedral, one of the architectural wonders of the world. It took almost 150 years to construct, and was finished in the 15th century.
		</p>
		<p>
			I had to buy tickets 3 days in advance to visit the dome, and even the free entry to the cathedral section involved a wait of hours in a queue that snaked around several blocks (I gave that a miss :-). It was high tourist season in Florence!!

			Here I'm wearing one of my one-of-a-kind Sari Art Wear pieces --- what I call a Long Overtop. Although the silhouette appears to have been discovered by a broader market recently, I've been creating variations on the Overtop theme for at least 15 years, and it is one of my signature styles.
