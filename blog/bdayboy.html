Nir Cohen is seen here celebrating his birthday wearing some of my Men's creations - Angkor Kurta and stretch poplin shorts.
</p>
<p>Nir is an entrepreneur, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/subterra.tlv">gym owner</a> and all around creative guy. He came into the atelier a little over a year ago. He was traveling through India with some friends and they had stopped in Auroville for a few weeks. Somehow he found our website, was intrigued by our Men's capsule, and decided to check out my creations first-hand.
</p>
<p>
Contrary to appearances, you do not need to have tattoos to wear my creations. However, many of my clients have a deep appreciation of art, and for some of them it extends to body-art. Whatever the reasons, we (unintentionally) have wound up with many images of tattoo-ed folk on our feed.

<p>When Nir first visited my atelier, I was busy with another client. My partner showed him around quickly and suggested he visit our primary outlet, La Boutique d'Auroville.
</p>
<p>
A few days later we were surprised when Nir showed up again, this time with a guy who looked like a movie star wearing one of my Woven Canvas T-shirts. It turned out that Nir had taken his friends to our outlet and they had already purchased a bunch of my creations. Now they wanted more, and more customized pieces, made-to-measure.

<p>The Adonis turned out to be Elrun Rosebaum, whose god-like physique and startling good looks hide the soul of a philosopher-poet, the eye of a brilliant photographer and the keen intellect and imagination of a genius creative director. We were thinking about starting our Instagram account at the time, and I spent many hours brainstorming with Elrun, gaining the benefit of his experience and knowledge.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, their third traveling companion, artist and tribal goddess <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kokedamaslove">Reut Agam</a>, had dropped by the studio independently to see my work. We instantly connected, and spent many hours and days together, working on jewellery designs, exploring the possibility of a larger artistic collaboration and just hanging out.
</p>
<p>This group of friends is a creative powerhouse, and their visit turned into a wonderful opportunity for personal and professional enrichment.</p>
