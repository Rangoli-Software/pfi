<h4 id="payment">Payments</h4>
<p>We accept international payments via PayPal on our website. If you are purchasing on the website and you prefer to pay by PayPal, skip the rest of this section.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, our preferred payment mechanism is a direct deposit into our bank account, for both Indian and International Payments. On the first payment, it is a little less convenient for our customers, but it is generally quite a bit cheaper, and much faster in many cases. Most bank transfer apps store the recipient info, so from your second purchase onward, it is very simple to do such a transfer.</p>
<h5>India</h5>
<p>If you are from India, bank transfers are fairly simple, and you probably already know how to do one. Here is the information you need.</p>

<h5>International</h5>
<p><strong>For our international customers, it is important that you send us the amount in Indian Rupees (INR), so that the Foreign Exchange conversion happens at your end, and all the costs are visible to you.</strong> Our customers' experience is that many banks and payment processors have hefty non-transparent charges for foreign exchange conversion and transfer commissions, so it pays to find an inexpensive, transparent, financial intermediary.</p>
<h6>Wise</h6>
<p>At the moment, the best intermediary for inexpensive cross-border transfers that we know about is <a href="https://wise.com">Wise</a> (formerly TransferWise). They also have an app on both iOS and Android. They are fully transparent about all costs, we receive the exact amount on the invoice, and you see all the fees and commissions at the time of payment. Here is the information you need for Wise.</p>

<p>There are now a plethora of other money transfer apps that enable direct international bank transfers, and the information above should work on all of them. If some other app works better for you, please go ahead and use it (do let us know, so we can add it to the list here).</p>
<h6>Wire Transfer / SWIFT</h6>
<p>The most common method that works is an International Wire Transfer using the SWIFT system. For this to work, you need to have the SWIFT code of our bank, information about our branch, as well as our account name and number. Some banks have low charges and good exchange rates for SWIFT international transfers. We have customers that have paid as low as 2-3 Euro for a wire transfer (some other customer have been charged as high as 50 euro as well). You need to make sure you understand what exchange rate you get for the INR conversion, in addition to the transfer fees. If you will do a lot of cross border transactions, it might be worth opening an account in a bank that offers low cost transfers.</p>
<p>If you know of some other cheap and convenient way to transfer money to an Indian bank account, please let us know.</p>
