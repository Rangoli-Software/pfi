<h1 id="payment">Payments</h1>
<p>We accept international payments via PayPal on our website. If you are purchasing on the website, you can skip the rest of this section.</p>
<p>Our preferred payment mechanism is a direct deposit into our bank account, for both Indian and International Payments. It is a little less convenient for our customers, but it is generally quite a bit cheaper and more efficient</p>
<p>If you are from India, bank transfers are fairly simple, and you probably already know how to do one. You'll find our account number and IFSC code at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>For our international customers, it is important that you send us the amount in Indian Rupees (INR), so that the Foreign Exchange conversion happens at your end, and all the costs are visible to you.</strong> Our customers' experience is that many banks and payment processors have hefty non-transparent charges for foreign exchange conversion and transfer commissions, so it pays to find an inexpensive, transparent, financial intermediary.</p>
<p>At the moment, the best intermediary for inexpensive cross-border transfers that we know about is <a href="https://transferwise.com">TransferWise</a>. They are fully transparent about all costs, we receive the exact amount on the invoice, and you see all the fees and commissions at the time of payment.</p>
<p>The most common method that works is an International Wire Transfer using the SWIFT system. For this to work, you need to have the SWIFT code of our bank, information about our branch, as well as our account name and number. Some banks have low charges and good exchange rates for SWIFT international transfers. We have customers that have paid as low as 2-3 Euro for a wire transfer (some other customer have been charged as high as 50 euro as well). You need to make sure you understand what exchange rate you get for the INR conversion, in addition to the transfer fees. If you will do a lot of cross border transactions, it might be worth having an account in a bank that offers low cost transfers.</p>
<p>If you know of some other cheap and convenient way to transfer money to an Indian bank account, please let us know.</p>
