                    question: "How do I order online?",
                    answer: "<p>We have just started selling some of our creations on the website, and will try to keep expanding the range of items that you can purchase in this way. In the meantime, whether you are ordering for yourself or for a shop, you can buy just about anything we design by emailing us with a list of items (or follow-up questions).</p>"

                    question: "Are the colors in the photographs accurate?",
                    answer: "<p>We do our best to ensure color fidelity. Our creations are photographed in natural light, all image production work is done on color-calibrated devices: they are edited on Macs, and tested for color on iPhones and iPads.</p><p>However, many garments look different based on the colour temperature, brightness, and direction of ambient lighting. There is also wide variation in the display of colors on different screens, and the perception of screen colour vs physical colour in different human brains. For these reasons, we cannot guarantee that the colors in the image you see will be exactly the same as the colors on the item you receive. In fact it is <strong>very likely that they will seem different</strong>! This is  true for every website, not just ours.</p><p>If you are a little flexible about exact shades, we are sure you will be pleased with any purchase from us. The harmonious use of color is one of the defining characteristics of Prema's designs.</p>"

                    id: "sizes",
                    question: "Item Sizing",
                    answer: "<p>Please be aware that our garment sizes may not correspond directly to European or American sizes.</p><p>For each item we provide a sizing chart that specifies the measurements of important dimensions. Please check on our chart to make sure the sizing is correct before placing your order.</p>"
                },
                {
                    id: "availability",
                    question: "Availability",
                    answer: "<p>You might have noticed that many of our creations are either one-of-a-kind or limited edition. Since our garments are on sale in several physical locations in addition to the website, there is a small chance that the one-of-a-kind item that you have selected has already been sold. In this case, we will let you select another item of the same kind, or refund your purchase price, as you prefer.</p>"

                    id: "packaging",
                    question: "A word about packaging",
                    answer: "<p>As much as anyone else, we love it when beautiful packages arrive in the mail. However, we are mindful that all of this extra packaging (used just once) is not at all eco-friendly. To lower our overall resource usage footprint, we recycle cardboard waste (all those Amazon boxes, anyone), and use low-cost, bio-degradable shipping envelopes, and bio-degradable cellophane envelopes for garment protection in transit.</p><p>We want you to value the experience of using our garments, and have reluctantly chosen to degrade your experience of receiving them. We hope you understand.</p>"

                    question: "Shipping Options",
                    answer: "<h5>India Post</h5><p>Our standard world-wide shipping method, and the one that we <strong>recommend to most international customers</strong>, is India Post's registered letter / parcel. These packages reach you in 14-15 business days world-wide. Over the years we have sent hundreds of packages by India Post and despite an occasional (very rare) delayed delivery, <strong>nothing has ever been lost</strong>. These packages are trackable on the India Post website, but require a signature at the time of delivery.</p><h5>Courier</h5><p>If you are in a hurry, We can also send packages by courier. This generally costs 2-3 times as much as India Post for international shipping, but the package will reach just about anywhere in the world in 4-5 business days (exclusive of customs delays).</p>"

                    id: "duties",
                    question: "Duties &amp; Tariffs for international shipping",
                    answer: "<p>Our prices include applicable Indian VAT, but do not include Customs and any other import duties or tariffs that might be levied in the destination country. In fact, we do not know what the precise duties are for every destination, and which articles / packages will require payment of duties, so we cannot calculate these in advance. If there are any additional duties, <strong>you will have to pay extra</strong> at the time you receive the package. Generally, the courier or delivery agent will contact you directly to pay for any extra charges, or charge you at the time of delivery. </p>"
