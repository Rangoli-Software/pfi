    <p>Born in Auroville, an International City in south india, near Pondicherry,
        I had the chance to live in a multi cultural environment, with an open
        spirit, and a different outlook on the world which gave meaning to my
        life.</p>
    <p>At a very young age I became fascinated by the textiles and
        colours of India, and this has never left me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I work with artisans from an ancient lineage
        of hand loom weaving. Their know how is extraordinary, their work is thorough and
        complex, and extremely time-consuming. Due to the economic pressures of globalization this heritage art
        form is in danger of extinction.</p>
    <p>
        My creations are a reflection of the amalgamation of my two cultures,
        Indian and Western.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sensuality of a movement, the flavor of a dish, music, paintings,
        architecture, the perfume of a flower - all of this inspires my work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being... in coherence.
