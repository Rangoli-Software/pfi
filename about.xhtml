    <p>I have been designing since I was a <a href="/journey/auroville.html">child growing up in Auroville</a>. I opened <a href="/journey/atelier.html">my Rangoli Atelier</a> here in 1999. Since then I have been fortunate to have thousands of clients from all over the world. I am grateful to all of you for supporting my passion, and proud to create items that are world-class in terms of design, materials, and craftsmanship.

        From early on, I have been drawn to the <a href="/journey/tangail.html">diaphanous, textured handloom fabrics of the Jamdani tradition</a>. They allow me to express myself with colour, texture, transparency and layering. Although I use various textiles in my designs, Tangail and Jamdani remain my signature fabrics.

        For more than a decade, I have been traveling to Bengal to collaborate with the artisanal Tangail communities outside Kolkata. I <a href="/journey/pfifabrics.html">commission custom fabrics directly from the weavers</a>. These textiles, designed at my Atelier, require the most technically demanding weaves, the finest yarns, and the most refined colors. This <a href="/beauty.html">challenges the weavers to produce their most beautiful work</a>, all at fair trade prices. I believe this is the most sustainable way to keep their tradition alive.

        You can see my work with Tangail in my line of <a href="/journey/artwear.html">one-of-a-kind ArtWear pieces</a>, as well as in the styles that use our in-house designed, custom-woven fabrics. <a href="/scarves.html">Scarves are a natural fit for custom weaves</a>, and I have been designing my own for many years.

        My love of movement and dance is reflected in a line of yoga / dance / leisure wear that is made from the finest modal jersey. I also have a line of every day wear for which I have used a variety of textiles from viscose to voile.

        I have been designing <a href="kidinmi.html">children’s garments for over 15 years</a>, and I have a limited but <a href="/vagabond.html">distinctive range of Men’s garments</a>, including a <a href="/products/ties/kagera.html">Necktie</a>.</p>
