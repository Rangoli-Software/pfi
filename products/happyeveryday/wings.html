    description: 'Our Happy Everyday collection also includes fun silhouettes in Khadi like the Lotus Wings Top - a very breezy style which will fit you now and 10 years later too. Its A-line flare makes it playful to wear and moving around easier. The sleeveless top is cut in 100% cotton Khadi which gives the top its structured fall that stays away from the skin. The classic Tan is versatile to pair with a lot of colours like electric blue, red, pink or black and white to keep it neutral. Pair it with boxy culottes or skinny jeans - the top can work with your taste and mood.',
