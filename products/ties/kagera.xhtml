	<p>For many years, I have thought about doing a designer tie. Ties are interesting because they are worn predominantly in formal or business settings. Yet the tie is an item of business attire which has <strong>personality</strong>. Soft tangail borders, with their refined, understated, luxurious look are perfect for a premium tie.</p>
	<p>Even though the basic design has been in my mind for years, I never seemed able to find the time to execute the idea. Last year, as we were finishing our flamboyant <strong>Vagabond</strong> Menswear, it finally felt like the right time, and I managed to manifest this arty neckwear.</p>

		<p>For the body of the tie, I used two layers of a textured khadi cotton. Each tie has a black back, and a coloured front. The black khadi is a pure shade, but all the other colours are blends.

		<p>Two different hues of homespun yarn are hand-loomed together, yielding a cloth with a two-tone colour. The rustic appearance of this fabric lends the tie an air of roughshod elegance.

		<p>To this base, I added the sophisticated sensuality of a soft tangail border. For each base, I picked a border that would harmonize with the two-tone khadi colour. Some of these borders are from my <strong>Tangail <a href="/journey/treasuretrove.html">Treasure Trove</a></strong> of impossible-to-find borders.

		<p>The others borders are custom, <a href="/journey/pfifabrics.html">designed by me in collaboration with the artisanal Tangail weavers</a>, and hand-loomed by them exclusively for Rangoli. Some are hand-spun cotton, others are silk, all are exquisite!

		<p>I was so pleased with the result that I was inspired to make a matching bag using the same fabric and border.</p>

		<p>It makes a great gift bag to present the tie!</p>

	<p>All of the ties can be worn with neutral coloured suits for business wear. The black and grey can be worn for formal occasions, and the coloured ones with a coordinated evening jacket for a night out, or even with just a shirt and jeans.</p>
	<figure><img src="/products/men/kagera/17.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block" /></figure>
	<p>I designed many combinations, some of which could only be made in limited quantities, due to the scarcity of the border. At the moment, we have <a href="/products/men/kagera.html">6 ties available</a></p>
	<p>The ties had just been finished when we did our photo shoot for Vagabond. The model was our favorite world-traveling maverick, photographer and documentary film-maker Sri Kolari, and the photographer for the shoot was Samvit Blass, creator and executive at Light Fish Designs.</p>
	<p>We got to fooling around with the tie and they both wound up modeling it - Sri in the Blue and Samvit in the Red. I think you'll agree that the results were really interesting!</p>
