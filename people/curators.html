<p>A lovely image of a beautiful couple (inside and out). Sarine Lawson, seen here wearing an ArtWear Naksha skirt, on the beach at Kennebunkport, with her husband.</p>
<p>Sarine is a brilliant curator of Indian Textiles. She discovers and collaborates with boutique-style Indian designers to bring their craftsmanship to the West. We are grateful for her support of our heritage traditions and the designers that are trying to keep them alive and flourishing.</p>
