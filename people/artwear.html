<p>A lovely image of the beautiful Prakruti Jain in Jodhpur. She is wearing one of my Art Wear Naksha skirts in the Midi length. Out-of-the-blue :-) 💙, this picture showed up on my FaceBook feed one day, and I asked Prakruti if she had a story about the skirt. Turns out she had been at a Tango festival and had an American friend recognize the skirt as being one of mine!

<p>It's always fun to see how creative and playful people can get when they fuse their own sense of style to my creations 😃. Here, you see the magnificent Mina (@m._i_n_.a @anandamidelaboratorium) wearing an Art Wear Naksha Minuit-length skirt as a dress paired with our Short Overtop. 💙👗

<p>I wish for my clients to feel pure joy, have a groove in their move, and be content in the present moment - always in the Now. 😌

In this image, you can see <a href="/look/gg.html">Naomi Shtilman</a> starting to swirl and dance in our skirts (check out our Instragram to see the full video clip), 💃🏽 lightening up the atelier with her infectious laughter. 😁 Her bubbly spirit brightens every colour she wears and livens up every place she goes. Naomi personifies the attributes that I want my clients to experience: Light☀️Beauty🌺Freedom💃🏼

Thank you Naomi for being the ideal muse and such a great friend. 🤗

<h6>Erika Lernot's "Dreams of Cuba"</h6>
<p>These are images of the gorgeous Erika Lernot wearing her Naksha Mini skirt as a strapless dress. These images first appeared in Erika's story <a href="http://www.lesvoyagesderika.fr/mon-look-reves-de-cuba-by-rangoli/" target="_blank">Dreams of Cuba</a>. Blogger, singer, model and world traveler - Erika was the model for our <a href="/summerdreams.html">Midsummer Night's Dream mood</a>.</p>

<p>The Naksha skirt - in 4 lengths - micro, mini, midi and minuit - is my signature silhouette. Each skirt is made from a single Tangail or Jamdani saree, matched with the appropriate lining to give a distinctive light-layering effect, where a third colour is visible due to the translucency of the fine Bengal muslin.</p>

<p>Each skirt is unique, cut from a single (usually one-of-a-kind) saree. The first version of the skirt was created almost 20 years ago, and I have created thousands of them since. I'm pretty sure no two have been identical. It is a super-comfortable, easy-to-wear piece, allowing free movement, and suitable for all ages and occasions.</p>

<p>The first Naksha skirts were created for me to wear while dancing and performing Salsa, so they had to be comfortable and allow full freedom of movement.</p>
<p>Since it is a crushed skirt - the garment is twisted into a rope in the final stages of drying and stored as such - it travels easily and does not require ironing. The resulting crinkling of the fabric adds additional texture to it's visual appearance.</p>
