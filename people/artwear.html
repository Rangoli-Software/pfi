<p>Images of friends wearing my signature ArtWear silhouettes.</p>
<h6>Erika Lernot's "Dreams of Cuba"</h6>
<p>These are images of the gorgeous Erika Lernot wearing her Naksha Mini skirt as a strapless dress. These images first appeared in Erika's story <a href="http://www.lesvoyagesderika.fr/mon-look-reves-de-cuba-by-rangoli/" target="_blank">Dreams of Cuba</a>. Blogger, singer, model and world traveler - Erika was the model for our <a href="/summerdreams.html">Midsummer Night's Dream mood</a>.</p>

<p>The Naksha skirt - in 4 lengths - micro, mini, midi and minuit - is my signature silhouette. Each skirt is made from a single Tangail or Jamdani saree, matched with the appropriate lining to give a distinctive light-layering effect, where a third colour is visible due to the translucency of the fine Bengal muslin.</p>

<p>Each skirt is unique, cut from a single (usually one-of-a-kind) saree. The first version of the skirt was created almost 20 years ago, and I have created thousands of them since. I'm pretty sure no two have been identical. It is a super-comfortable, easy-to-wear piece, allowing free movement, and suitable for all ages and occasions.</p>

<p>The first Naksha skirts were created for me to wear while dancing and performing Salsa, so they had to be comfortable and allow full freedom of movement.</p>
<p>Since it is a crushed skirt - the garment is twisted into a rope in the final stages of drying and stored as such - it travels easily and does not require ironing. The resulting crinkling of the fabric adds additional texture to it's visual appearance.</p>
