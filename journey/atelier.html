    <p>It seems I was fated to become a fashion designer. Around the time I started selling my first <strong>Naksha</strong> skirts, a large garment unit in Auroville - Aurosarjan - had to shut their doors. Concerned for the welfare of the dozens of laid-off workers, the Auroville community encouraged the creation of new units that could employ them and utilize the workshop spaces left behind.</p>
    <p>I saw that these talented artisans - highly-skilled cutters, tailors, embroiderers and other professionals - were capable of producing world-class hand-crafted garments. In 1999, with the encouragement of family, friends and well-wishers, I took the plunge, hired some of the laid-off artisans, and started Rangoli in a single 24 square meter room of the old Aurosarjan factory. Over the years, we grew organically as our business increased, and I occupied space left by other units.</p>

    <p>The Rangoli team is like a family. I spend time every day with each and every individual. Our relationship is based on care and respect and goes beyond the work place at Rangoli, into our personal lives and well being.  We are a fun loving team, always striving to do our best and collaborate with one another.  We share our thoughts and aspirations, we learn from each other. Together we grow and advance, always with a big smile.</p>
    <p>Although we have gone through some difficult times in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I feel pleased and privileged that many of our present team of garment workers have been with me from the very beginning.</p>
